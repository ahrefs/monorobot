# Notabot

Notifications bot server to receive notifications from webhooks and post them to slack

## Setting Up

Install dependencies, if needed:

```sh
opam install --deps-only .
```

Build with

```sh
make
```

and use resulting `_build/default/src/notabot.exe` binary.

## Running

Configuration is read at startup from `notabot.json` and `secrets.json` files
according to `lib/notabot.atd` schema.

### Config File

The config file is where the variables affecting the behaviour of notabot are defined. It mainly consists of three categories of rules to filter notifications; status, prefix and label, in each there may be more than one type of rule.

For details about each field in the config, please refer to [notabot.atd](./lib/notabot.atd).

Here is an example of a [config file](./test/notabot.json).

### Secret file

Secret file is where sensitive information such as the urls used for webhooks and other tokens are stored.

Likewise for details about each field in the secret file, please refer to [notabot.atd](./lib/notabot.atd).

Here is an example of a [secret file](./test/secrets.json).

#### Token generation

Some event notifications (e.g., status, commit comment) require a personal token to be addded to the configuration. To create a personal token, take the following steps:
1. Verify your email address, if needed.
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
1. In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
1. In the left sidebar, click **Personal access tokens**.
1. Click **Generate new token**.
1. Give your token a descriptive name in the **Note** section.
1. Grant ***repo*** scope.
1. Click **Generate token**.
1. Copy the token to `secrets.json` file in a `gh_token` field.

For more detailed instructions on token generation, refer to https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line.

#### Webhook Secret

For more information on `gh_webhook_secret` see [developer.github.com/webhooks/securing](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/)

## Testing (development)

```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/github \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'User-Agent: {whatever user agent you define}' \
  -H 'X-Github-Event: pull_request' \
  -H 'X-Hub-Signature: {a signature value you define}' \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -d @mock_payloads/pr_notification.json
```

There are more payloads which will use a different `X-Github-Event` signature:

```
pull_request => mock_payloads/pr_notification.json
push => mock_payloads/push_notification.json
check_suite => mock_payloads/ci_notification.json
```
