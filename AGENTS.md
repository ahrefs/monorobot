## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`

**CRITICAL** Track all work in beads. Before starting any task, run `bd ready`.
Before ending any session, run `bd sync`. File discovered work with `bd create`.
